Description: A cluster of functions to help facilitate administration of
    multi-centre research using R and REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). It
    allows automatic allocation of users within a REDCap project to data access groups
    with appropriate user rights, and supplies several functions to support
    this. It also contains functions which allow the easy creation of summaries, reports
    (e.g. of missing data), authorship lists, and sharable data dictionaries.
